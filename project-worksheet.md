## Project Description

Project 1 is the creation of my portfolio. In this repo you will see my portfolio webpage in which several of my projects display my skills in JQuery, HTML/CSS, Flexbox/Grid, and soon React. Navigating through my portfolio site, you will be able to see the use of HTML/CSS, Flexbox/Grid, and JQuery. This site will constantly be updated as I will continue to add new projects and remove projects.

#### MVP 

- View an example of one project from my portfolio for each category.
- Navigate and scroll through the page being able to select a nav element 	or one of the project links taking you to the rest of the projects in that category.
- Allow user to choose see the where the project was created along with its code.
- Contact me on the lower portion of the site using the form at the bottom of the page.

#### PostMVP 

- CSS Animations will improve over time.
- Links will be added to fully display my projects within their sections.


## Functional Components

I estimate using Flex for my initial Nav should take no more than 2 hours. Adding content to my page using HTML/CSS to display what I want the user to see should take approximately 2 hours. Organizing the contents using JQuery will take a bit longer and I anticipate that will take about 3-4 hours to complete depending on the responsive portion of the project. The contact portion and input boxes should not take very long and I estimate that will take between 1-2 hours.

This was the algorithm used to extract the data from a google sheet using JSON, JQuery and Javascript.

## Issues and Resolutions
 *I encountered issues uploading data from the googlesheet. Images were not appearing and there were no errors shown in my developer tools. I was able to change the algorithm and use bootstrap which made pulling data a little clearer and a little more organized.

 *Styling gave me trouble. When I first uploaded my content to the page the initial layout was changed completely. I deleted everything on my stylesheet and started over which made everything clear and I was able to find a solution.

 *Initially I set all my content through HTML and CSS and nothing from JQuery. I went back into fix the issue and had to change the algorithm so that the content was coming from javascript and jquery and not just Bootstrap on HTML.
