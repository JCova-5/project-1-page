#### MVP 

- View an example of one project from my portfolio for each category.
- Navigate and scroll through the page being able to select a nav element 	or one of the project links taking you to the rest of the projects in that category.
- Allow user to choose favorites.
- Contact me on the lower portion of the site using.

#### PostMVP 

- Anything else that is not MVP

## Functional Components

I estimate using Flex for my initial Nav should take no more than 2 hours. Adding content to my page using HTML/CSS to display what I want the user to see should take approximately 2 hours. Organizing the contents using JQuery will take a bit longer and I anticipate that will take about 3-4 hours to complete depending on the responsive portion of the project. The contact portion and input boxes should not take very long and I estimate that will take between 1-2 hours.
