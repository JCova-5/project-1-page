# Project Overview

## Project Schedule

This schedule will be used to keep track of your progress throughout the week and align with our expectations.  

You are **responsible** for scheduling time with your squad to seek approval for each deliverable by the end of the corresponding day, excluding `Saturday` and `Sunday`.

|  Day | Deliverable | Status
|---|---| ---|
|Day 1| Project Description | Complete
|Day 1| Wireframes / Priority Matrix / Timeline | Complete
|Day 3| Core Application Structure (HTML, CSS, etc.) | Incomplete
|Day 4| MVP & Bug Fixes | Incomplete
|Day 5| Final Touches | Incomplete
|Day 6| Present | Incomplete


## Project Description

Project 1 is the creation of my portfolio. In this repo you will see several of my projects displaying my skills in JQuery, HTML/CSS, Flexbox/Grid, and React.

## Google Sheet

Include link to your google sheet here.  Here is the sample [Joe had used in class](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/15PmioBi2dQEkewpqI7MDkDpvcVF0Trw8vmarAQbwoHk/edit#gid=0) 

## Wireframes

Upload images of wireframe to cloudinary and add the link here with a description of the specific wireframe. Do not include the actual image and have it render on the page.

## Time/Priority Matrix 

[Time/Priority Matrix](https://www.figma.com/file/q3dfFMsRx5wq8gVjxL2kD1/Untitled?node-id=0%3A1)

Include a full list of features that have been prioritized based on the `Time and Priority` Matix.  This involves drawing a a square.  In the middle of the square, on the x axis draw a line.  The most left part of the line should start with 0hrs and the end of the line should include 2hrs.  This line will be used to estimate how much time any one feature will take to complete. 

Now draw a vertical line on the y axis.  The top of this line should have `High` and the bottom `Low`.  This line will be used to assign a priority to to each feature you wish to include in the project.  

Now create a separate list starting with A and assign it one of the features.  Continue to assign each feature a letter.  Once complete add each letter to the matrix assigning based on what your feel it's prioirty is an how long it will take to implement. If any one feature takes longer than 2hrs to complete than break it down into smaller tasks and reassign them a new letter. 

Once complete tally up the time and determine how long the project will take to complete. Now break those features into MVP and PostMVP so you can guarantee you will have a fully functioning project to demo. 

### MVP/PostMVP - 5min

The functionality will then be divided into two separate lists: MPV and PostMVP.  Carefully decided what is placed into your MVP as the client will expect this functionality to be implemented upon project completion.  

#### MVP (examples)

- View an example of one project from my portfolio for each category.
- Navigate and scroll through the page being able to select a nav element 	or one of the project links taking you to the rest of the projects in that category.
- Allow user to choose favorites.
- Contact me on the lower portion of the site using.

#### PostMVP 

- Anything else that is not MVP

## Functional Components

I estimate using Flex for my initial Nav should take no more than 2 hours. Adding content to my page using HTML/CSS to display what I want the user to see should take approximately 2 hours. Organizing the contents using JQuery will take a bit longer and I anticipate that will take about 3-4 hours to complete depending on the responsive portion of the project. The contact portion and input boxes should not take very long and I estimate that will take between 1-2 hours.

#### MVP

| Responsive | H | 3hr | -hr | -hr|
